# Tweet Anywhere

Tweet Anywhere is a web app that allows users to search for Tweets from any location around the globe, view them on Twitter, and save them to a public collection if they really like it. It is my first attempt at building a web app, with the primary goal being to better familiarize myself with Reactjs. In addition to React, Tweet Anywhere is built with a Node/Express/MongoDB back-end, mainly for creating RESTful APIs to access the Tweet database.
